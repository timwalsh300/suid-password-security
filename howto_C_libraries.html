	<h2>C Libraries</h2>

 In general, libraries are created from many library source files, and are 
 either built as archive files (libmine.a) that are statically linked into 
 executables that use them, or as shared object files (libmine.so) that are
 dynamically linked into executables that use them.   To link in libraries
 of these types, use the gcc command line options -L for the path to the
 library files and -l to link in a library (a .so or a .a): 

<pre>    -L{path to file containing library} -l${library name}
</pre>

 For example, if I have a library named libmine.so in /home/newhall/lib/
 then I'd do the following to link it into my program:

<pre>   $ gcc -o myprog myprog.c  -L/home/newhall/lib -lmine 
</pre>

 You may also need to specify and include path so the compiler can
 find the library header file:  -I /home/newhall/include
 <p>
 If you create your own shared object files and do not install them
 in /usr/lib, then you need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
 variable so that the runtime linker can
 find them and load them at run time.  For example, if I put my .so 
 files in a directory named lib in my home directory, I'd set my
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment to the following:
</p><pre>  # if running bash:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/newhall/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  # if running tcsh:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/newhall/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>

<h2> USING AND LINKING LIBRARY CODE</h2>

<pre>To use a Library that is not linked into your program automatically by
the compiler, you need to (1) include the library's header file in your
C source file (test.c in the example below), and (2) tell the compiler to
link in the code from the library .o file into your executable file:

    step 1: Add an include line (#include "somelib.h") in a program 
            source file (e.g., test.c).

    step 2: Link the program's .c file with the library object file 
	    (i.e. specify the somelib.o file as a command line argument to gcc): 

	% gcc  -o myprog test.c somelib.o
 
    The resulting executable file (myprog) will contain machine code 
    for all the functions defined in test.c plus any mylib library 
    functions that are called by 
</pre>

<h2> CREATING AND USING YOUR OWN LIBRARY CODE</h2>
   To create a Library of code you need to do the following:

<ul>
<li> (1) Create an INTERFACE to your library:  mylib.h
<p>
</p></li><li> (2) Create an IMPLEMENTATION of your library: mylib.c
<p>

</p></li><li> (3) Create a LIBRARY OBJECT FILE that can be linked with
            programs that want to use our library code

<p>
</p></li><li> (3a) or create a SHARED OBJECT FILE from many .o files that
             can be linked with programs that want to use your library code
<p>

</p></li><li> (4)    USE the library in other C code: 
           (a) #include "mylib.h"
           (b) link in the libary code into a.out file 

<p>
</p></li><li> (5) Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable 
				for finding shared objects in non-standard locations at runtime
</li></ul>

<h4>Details:</h4>
<ul>
<li> (1) INTERFACE: the header file to your library should contain
definitions for everything exported by your library:
<ul>
<li>function prototypes with comments for users of your library functions
</li><li>definitions for types and global variables exported by your library
</li></ul>
<p>
You should have "boiler plate" code (#ifndef ... #endif) around the 
header file's contents, to ensures that the preprocessor only includes 
the mylib.h file one time.
</p><p>
Here is what an example .h file might look like:
</p><pre>#ifndef _MYLIB_H_
#define _MYLIB_H_

    // a constant definition exported by library:
    #define MAX_FOO  20

    // a type definition exported by library:
		struct foo_struct {  
        int x;
        float y;
    };
    typedef struct foo_struct foo_struct;

    // a global variable exported by library
    // "extern" means that this is not a variable declaration, it 
    // just defines that a variable named total_foo of type int
    // exits and you can use it (its declaration is in some library source file)
    extern int total_foo; 	

    // a function prototype for a function exported by library:
    extern int foo(float y, float z);   // a very bad function name

#endif
</pre>

</li><li> (2) IMPLEMENTATION: create a mylib.c file that #includes "mylib.h" and 
    contains the implementation of every function in your library.
    
<pre>    #include "mylib.h"

    ...
    int total_foo;

    int foo(float y, float z) { 
	...
    }
</pre>

</li><li> (3) create a LIBRARY OBJECT FILE that can be linked into other programs
    that use your library (use the -c option to gcc to tell it just
    to create an object file (a .o file) rather than an executable:
<pre>    gcc -o mylib.o -c mylib.c
</pre>
    
    you can then use the mylib.o file as the "library file" and statically
    link it into other programs that use it, or...
<p>
</p></li><li> (3a) alternately, you can create a SHARED OBJECT FILE from one or more .o 
       files that can be linked into other programs that use your library 
       A shared object file is the Unix name for a dynamically linked library
       whose code is loaded into the a.out file at runtime.

       To create a .so file use the -shared flag to gcc.  Here is what an 
       example build might look like:
  
<pre>       gcc -shared -o libmylib.so  mylib.o blah.o grr.o  -lm 
</pre>

</li><li> (3b) you could also build an ARCHIVE FILE (a statically linked 
			 library, libmylib.a) from one or more .o files.  If you link with 
			 a static library, its code is copied into the a.out file at runtime.
       <p>
       See gcc documentation for more information on how to build .a and .so files.

</p><p>
</p></li><li> (4) USE the library in other programs:
<pre>    step 1: Add an include line (#include "mylib.h") in all program source files that use library definitions (e.g., test.c).

    step 2: Link the program's .c file with the library object file 
            (i.e. specify the mylib.o file as a command line argument to gcc): 

             gcc  test.c mylib.o

        OR to link in libmylib.so (or libmylib.a):

             gcc  test.c -lmylib

        OR to link with a library not in the standard path:

             gcc  test.c -L/home/newhall/lib -lmylib

        The resulting a.out out will contain machine code for all the functions 
        defined in test.c plus any mylib library functions that are called by 
        the test.c code. 

</pre>

</li><li> (5) RUNNING an executable linked with a shared object file:

<pre>   If the shared object file in not in /usr/lib, then you need to set your 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that the runtime linker can find 
   and load your .so file into the executable at runtime:

   # in bash:
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/newhall/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   # in tcsh:
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/newhall/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
</li></ul>
